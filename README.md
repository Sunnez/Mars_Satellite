# Mars Satellite Simulation
Developed an algorithm to simulate and plot the motion of a satellite around Mars. 
Implemented a differential equation solver for gravitational differential equations. 
Explored effects on energy and angle deviation of launching the satellite from different positions, with mars stationary and moving.
