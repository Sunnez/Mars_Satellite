# Mars Satellite Simulation
Developed an algorithm to simulate and plot the motion of a satellite around Mars. 
Implemented a differential equation solver for gravitational differential equations. 
Explored effects on energy and angle deviation of launching the satellite from different positions, with mars stationary and with mars moving.

Stable orbits and escape orbits:
